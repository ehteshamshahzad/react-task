Use the free API at https://www.weatherapi.com to build a React website that can display a 10-day weather forecast with all the basic functions, including city name, current weather icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It must display the recording of high and low temperatures of each day, including image icons for sunny/rainy/ cloudy/snowy weather conditions.
It should have a responsive design and refresh every 5 minutes with exact temperature and weather conditions.
Upon clicking on a particular day, the hourly forecast for that day should get displayed.
